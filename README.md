# Project: Polynomial Approximation and Weather Forecast
In this repository, there is an implemention for polynomial approximation along with the results of the implementation, datasets, analyisis of the results and some toughtful conclusions you can derive from this project. The data tha was used comes from the Official Site of the Goverment CONAGUA, which has datasets from the weather in all states in Mexico between 1985 - 2019. The site you can visit is the following 'https://datos.gob.mx/busca/dataset/temperatura-promedio-excel'

##Methodology
From a Mathematical perspective we derive the approximation via using the least square minimals and the solution of linear equations via using different methods, but one in particular that resulted in an effective when using so many data, the Cholesky Method.
